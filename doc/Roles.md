#Roles
------

###Ansible roles are portable containers of tasks and variables.

Before writing your first role, please review the [Composition and Style Guide](./Composition and Style.md).

Roles are implemented in [Playbooks](Documented_Playbooks.md).


##TODO: move the descriptions to README.md files in each individual role folder and link to the repo below.  I think this makes much more sense.
